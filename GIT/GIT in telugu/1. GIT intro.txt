Svn
----
--server client based
--Internet connection is very important every time
--server burden is increased
--centralized version control
--each local system is a backup, if server is at risk then the cose is lost
---very difficult to find conflicts
GIT
----
--here every client is individual
--internet is needed when we need to push the code to the hub
--server burden is less
--distributed version control
--no backup automatically
--conflicts are there

which platforms?
	windows, linux, Solaris, and Mac
