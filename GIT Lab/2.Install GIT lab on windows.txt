--Create a folder GitLab_Runner
--download gitlab runner 64bit(amd64)
--change the name as gitlab-runner.exe
--open cmd prompt in that path
--gitlab-runner.exe register
  https://gitlab.com
  get the cli-token after registering with the GitLab
  create a project (webApp)
  go to settings-->CI/CD-->runners(expand)
  (we need to setup shared/specific runner
  runner is a isolated virtual machine which runs a job
  runner that serves all projects is shared runner
  group runner--when we have mutiple projects under a group)
  copy paste the codde from specific runner
  and give docker to run
  give tags(devtag1, devtag2)
  now you can see runner is setup..in CI/CD runners
  we can see config file in the gitlab-runner.exe path
--setup is done
